Python Playground

My Python Projects for myself study.

I am happy to share with you my path of learning,
how to code this.

=======
This is my Python Playground. 
Where i try some coding in Python,
i use the book "automate the boring
stuff" by Al Sweigart. 

For me as an beginner it is the best choice,
to start coding.

# PythonCrashcourse
I go here trough the book "Python Crashcourse" by Eric Matthes

I will make a directory for every chapter and will publish there my try outs.

I just started with coding and want to learn python also.

The Book so far is very easy to read and to follow along,
i never had the feeling nto be lost so far.
